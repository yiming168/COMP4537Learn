# Quiz 9: Web Architecture Pattern

## Q1. In the context of web application architecture, what is the primary focus?

- Answer: **Reliability, scalability, security, ease of implementation, and modularity.**

## Q2. Which of the following is a direct benefit of studying architectural patterns?

- Answer: **Helps evaluate efficiency, robustness, security, and maintenance costs.**

## Q3. A monolithic architecture is typically simple to build and deploy but can become hard to scale and maintain as complexity grows.

- Answer: **True**

## Q4. In a Microservice Architecture, how do services typically communicate with each other?

- Answer: **Via API calls**

## Q5. Large companies like Netflix or Discord often use a single, unchanging architectural pattern throughout their existence.

- Answer: **False**

## Q6. In a Microservice Architecture, if one service fails (e.g., the user profile service), what is a likely consequence for other services?

- Answer: **Other services can potentially continue operating if they don't depend on the failed one.**

## Q7. In the API-centric architecture, what is the common format for data payloads in API responses?

- Answer: **JSON**

## Q8. Match the architectural pattern with its primary characteristic.

- Answer: **Event-Driven Architecture**

## Q9. Which architecture is most suitable for a large-scale system like Netflix or Amazon that requires high scalability and independent team ownership?

- Answer: **Microservices Architecture**

## Q10. Select the advantages of a Microservice Architecture.


## Q11. Place the following architectural patterns in the order that a growing tech startup would typically adopt them, from earliest to latest.


## Q12. In a Layered (n-Tier) Architecture, what is the primary purpose of separating the data access layer from the business logic layer?

- Answer: **To ensure regulatory compliance, testability, and maintainability.**

## Q13. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is best for web frameworks when...

- Answer: **the core business logic must be completely decoupled from all external systems.**

## Q14. What is a key development benefit of an API-centric, service-based architecture?

- Answer: **It enables a new service to be written in a different technology stack (e.g., Node.js) and hooked up to an existing app (e.g., Django).**

## Q15. In a monolithic architecture, adding a new feature often requires recompiling and redeploying the entire application.

- Answer: **True**

## Q16. What is the primary purpose of the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) pattern?

- Answer: **To decouple core business logic from external systems like databases and UIs.**
- Explanation: The goal of this pattern is to isolate the application's core logic from outside concerns (like the database, UI, or third-party APIs). This makes the core logic independent of technology choices, easier to test, and more maintainable.
